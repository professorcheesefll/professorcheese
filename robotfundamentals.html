            <h1>Module 9: Building a Robot</h1>

            <p>You don't need tutorials. This is merely a checklist module of what to build to make your robot good. You're already a capable builder if you've gone through all the modules until now. Now is the time to build two things: A robot and a universal gear frame for future tools. </p>
        </div>

            <h2>To Make a Good Robot, You Need...</h2>

            <ul class="normalul">
                <li>
                    <strong>Low center of gravity</strong>: Your robot must have most of the materials it's made up of down rather than up. This improves control over the entire robot's movement, helping it not tip over easily. This ties closely with weight distribution towards the back.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Weight-distribution towards the back</strong>: The back has to be the area with more of the weight because the front carries tools, and if you want your robot to perform well (turn properly), then back-weight is a great idea.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Lots of surface area where tools could be placed</strong>: Surface area on the front of a robot is excellent for these reasons:
                    <ul class="normalulelaborate">
                        <li>
                            Gives technicians lots of room to adjust and place tools.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            More gap between gears (to add gear ratios or to have 2 small motors).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ability to go around the entire FLL field without deviating from the set path</strong>: You'd likely need a very stable robot with a border around.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Example Robot: CH33S3C4K3-01 (by Professor Cheese)</h2>
            <p>Professor Cheese created this CAD as a representation of all 4 criteria. It doesn't mean it's the best robot for FLL. It's meant to teach.</p>
            <div class="glass">
                <img src="module9image1.png" class="rounded-image">
                <a href="Module9-Model1.io" class="linkbutton linkbutton--newline" download>Download Studio 2.0 File</a>
            </div>

            <p>The image you see above looks different from previous modules because Studio's own Photorealistic render was used. This creates realistic images of a model! It's not AI. You can download the file to see exactly how it's been built. 2 interesting features on this robot include a border that supports the large motors and wheels, and the surface for tools at the front (which includes a compatible area for knob gears). Those knobs can easily be switched out for normal gears, and they're used here to remind you that knob gears exist. Using knob gears also provides tons of grip between the motor and the driver gear.</p>

            <h2>What's a Universal Gear Frame?</h2>

            <p>A universal gear frame is supposed to be one of 3 modules of your robot at any time. It's responsible for transferring rotational motion from your robot to the tool. Your first base module is the robot. Think of it like its own section. The second module is the universal gear frame. A third module can be an additional attachment, like a tool. Below is an example of a frame for CH33S3C4K3-01.</p>

            <div class="glass">
                <img src="module9image2.png" class="rounded-image">
                <a href="Model9-Model2.io" class="linkbutton linkbutton--newline" download>Download Studio 2.0 File</a>
            </div>

            <p>This universal gear frame goes right on top of the front area of the robot. You can download both Studio files yourself to put them together to see it happen.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why Do I Need a Universal Gear Frame?</h2>

            <p>You need a universal gear frame because:</p>

            <ul class="normalul">
                <li>
                    You can now modfy the space that your tool sits on without modifying your robot.
                </li>

                <li>
                    You can switch out gear frames whenever you need to, depending on what you want for aesthetics.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>You should:</p>

            <ul class="normalul">
                <li>
                    Combine your universal gear frame and tool when it is time for the competition. Do this for all the tools. You're only keeping them seperate before competition for the benefits listed above.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Keep your universal gear frame very simple. Don't make it thicker than 3 studs. That's going to cause the center of gravity shift upwards, and it means your frame is doing more than it needs to. If you're stuck, start with Professor Cheese's frame design above.
                </li>
            </ul>
