        <h1>Module 3: SPIKE Prime and LEGO Technic Tips</h1>

        <p>Thinking like an engineer and using Studio 2.0 are important, but you cannot do them efficiently without specific nuances in SPIKE Prime and LEGO Geometry. In this module, we'll learn about the SPIKE set 
            and LEGO's Geometry. We'll also look at the fundamental errors made while using lego pins and axles.

<h2>Owning your SPIKE Set</h2>

<p>The SPIKE Set contains the basic electronic components you'll need (sensors, wires, and the hub) plus some other non-essential LEGO Technic parts. 
    On Studio, you can turn on "45678-1 SPIKE Prime Set" to see these essential components:
</p>
<img src="module3image1.png" class="rounded-image">

<h3>A Brief Introduction to Sensors</h3>
<p>Humans can live without bumping into walls and stepping on tacks because we have sense organs. Without your eyes, nose, mouth, and ears, you won't be able to take inputs from the world around you. 
    That's what sensors do for us. They take inputs, which our brain uses to take action accordingly. Robots, such as the ones you can build using SPIKE Prime have sensors, which take the input to let the hub decide what to do next.
</p>


<h3>The "Electric" Components</h3>

<p>There are 4 electric components. One of them is the "Electric Rechargeable Battery" that gets attached to the Hub. The others are sensors such as the "Electric Sensor, Color", "Electric Sensor, Distance", and the "Electric Sensor, Force" 
</p>

<h4>The Color Sensor</h4>

<p>The Color Sensor's job is to detect color. Hence the name. You can use basic code to take in inputs from your color sensor if it is attached to your robot. This is what a color sensor typically looks like:</p>

<img src="module3image2.png" class="rounded-image">

<h4>The Distance (Ultrasonic) Sensor:</h4>

<p>The Distance Sensor's job is to detect the distance it is from a solid object. It uses sound that humans can't hear to detect distances effectively. Sound bounces off the solid object and returns to the sensor, and the time it takes for that to happen determines the distance.</p>

<img src="module3image3.png" class="rounded-image">

<h4>The Force Sensor</h4>

<p>While the Force Sensor <strong>isn't</strong> used very <strong>often</strong> in FLL, it has its own purpose. It can detect if something is touching the black knob it has at the front or not, and if so, how hard it is pressing on it. It uses the unit Newtons to measure how much force is being applied.
</p>

<img src="module3image4.png" class="rounded-image">

<h3>The "Electric, Motor" Parts</h3>

<p>SPIKE Prime includes two motors. These components can turn items that are attached to them.</p>

<h4>The Large Motor</h4>

<p>The Large Motor is widely used on your robot for movement. This is because they are significantly more powerful than small motors for movement, and this allows them to live heavier things across larger distances more reliably.</p>

<img src="module3image5.png" class="rounded-image">

<h4>The Small Motor</h4>

<p>The Small Motor, on the other hand, is more often used for activating tools. They can turn gears on your tools easily and are typically built for that purpose. The SPIKE Prime Set comes with 2 of them.</p>

<img src="module3image6.png" class="rounded-image">

<p>Keep in mind however, that you may use the small motors for movement rather than the larger ones.</p>


<h3>The Hub (Only Part in "Electric, Programmable")</h3>

<p>The only element that is programmable is the Hub. This is where all of your code is uploaded, and it gets all of its ports connected to the motors and sensors you want to use. It also gets attached to the "Electric" part called "Electric Rechargeable Battery" to be operational, which is why it wasn't given its own image earlier.</p>
<img src="module3image7.png" class="rounded-image">

<p>The Hub is the most important part out of all your essential elements. Without it, no part of your robot can function. It is the brain.</p>

<h2>LEGO Technic Tips</h2>

<p>LEGO has interesting specs that you need to learn to make building more efficient.</p>

<h3>The Units</h3>

<p>This part below is 5 units wide. These units are commonly called <strong>"studs"</strong> or <strong>"modules"</strong>. It is important to know what they are called because while referring to them, a name makes communication more effective.</p>

<img src="module3image8.png" class="rounded-image">

<p>Learning each part's geometry (module length) can lead to better spatial reasoning (visualizing a potential solution).</p>

<h3>The Pins</h3>

<p>Commonly, you'll find these two pins. They are different, and a lot of people mix them up. The one on the right is the <strong>non-friction</strong> pin. The one on the left is the <strong>friction</strong> pin.</p>

<img src="module3image9.png" class="rounded-image">

<p>For builds that don't need to be hinged and rotated frequently, the best piece to use is the friction pin. If you use a non-friction pin for the structure of a tool, then it might collapse or jitter frequently.</p>

<p>Here are more friction and non-friction pins. The ones on the right are non-friction pins, and the ones on the left are friction pins. You'll see a mix of 2 module and 3 module variants.</p>

<img src="module3image10.png" class="rounded-image">

<h3>Axles and Pins are Color-Coded</h3>

<p>While building, a pro-tip is not just to blindly keep measuring axles and pins. As you've seen in the image from before, the non-friction pins are all in shades of tan and light-bluish grey, while the friction ones are all in the black and blue shades. Axles have the same idea. The odd module lengths are all light-bluish grey or yellow typically, while the even module lengths are all black or red.</p>

<img src="module3image11.png" class="rounded-image">

<p>The odd length axles are on the right, while the even lengths are on the left. When you pick these parts up, knowing this subtle difference can help you identify them quicker.</p>

<h3>Illegal Techniques</h3>

<p>Illegal techniques will not get you arrested, but they'll leave your building at rest. They can make parts loosen, bend, deform, and even pop after lots of stress.</p>

<p>An illegal tehcnique occurs when a part is being stressed beyond its capabilities (in design). There are many examples of illegal techniques, and your job is to <strong>not use them at all</strong> because they can waste debugging time and valuable technician practicing later.</p>

<h4>Misuse of Pin and Brick</h4>
<div class="glass">
<img src="module3image12.png" class="rounded-image">
<a href="Module 3 | Module 1.io" class="linkbutton linkbutton--newline" download>Download Studio 2.0 File</a>
</div>
<p>
    In this image, the pin is being forced into the brick. This causes the pin to warp, and in the future the pin will lose its clutch power. You'll see that is an actual issue when "Collision" is turned on in Studio:
</p>

<img src="module3image13.png" class="rounded-image">

<h4>Misuse of Brick and Liftarm</h4>
<div class="glass">
    <img src="module3image14.png" class="rounded-image">
    <a href="Module 3 | Model 2.io" class="linkbutton linkbutton--newline" download>Download Studio 2.0 File</a>
</div>

<p>This case slowly bends the liftarm and the brick, warping the studs on the brick, and damaging the liftarm's studs/modules.</p>

<h4>Misuse of Liftarms</h4>
<div class="glass">
    <img src="module3image15.png" class="rounded-image">
    <a href="Module 3 | Model 3.io" class="linkbutton linkbutton--newline" download>Download Studio 2.0 File</a>
</div>

<p>While this is impossible to show on Studio 2.0 due to the limits of CAD, it involves the stretching of the purple liftarm to make sure it connects with both the friction technic pins. This is one of the wost illegal techniques ever, and it is <strong>not recommended.</strong></p>
</section>

<h3>Detecting Illegal Techniques</h3>

<p>Not everything can be detected visually, so here are some commonalities:</p>

<ul class="normalul">
    <li>
        If a contraption feels hard to put together (parts resist to do be built together), it is highly likely that it's an illegal technique.
    </li>

    <li>
        The contraption easily loosens over time.
    </li>

    <li>
        The effectiveness of the contraption is mediocre compared to confirmed methods and lacks consistency.
    </li>

    <li>
        The parts in the contraption crack and break over time.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Remember to keep an eye on these issues.</p>
