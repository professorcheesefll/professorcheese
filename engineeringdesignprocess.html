<h1>Module 1: Engineering Design Process</h1>
<p>This process helps builders think in a methodical, organized, and <strong>systematic</strong> way. Good news: you don't want to memorize it. Many people automatically run this process in their heads.
    You've probably thought out things in a similar way too, without realizing it. The key is not to force yourself to do things a certain way, but to execute ideas in <strong>cohesion</strong> with your team
    by following this system. 
</p>
</div>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Identify the Problem</h2>

<p>Imagine something goes wrong. Your tool doesn't complete the mission as planned. This is where you <strong>don't freak out.</strong> Instead, you should try to understand why <strong>something isn't working</strong> and write the problem down on a piece
    of paper. This problem has to be the most <strong>root cause</strong>, and you must always strive to find the simplest thing that is breaking your efforts. If you're writing down more than 1 sentence for it, you're distracted and actually don't know what it is. If this happens,
    try again, and talk to your teammates to bounce ideas off each other.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Research the Problem</h2>

<p>Researching can mean many things. It can end with procrastination or <strong>information.</strong> The primary goal of researching your problem is to <strong>expand</strong> your view. It's very good for you 
    and the solution you will attempt first. You start your research with your initial guess from the identification stage. For example, if your tool didn't deliver an item from one side to another because the item kept slipping, you might guess that 
    because there wasn't enough surface area for your item to sit on (this is still part of your root cause). Now, you consult experts (like your coach or mentor) to kindly explain what your root cause was actually doing. You can even come to Professor 
    Cheese here to learn more.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Brainstorm Solutions</h2>

<p>This is perhaps the most <strong>collaborative</strong> part of the process. Brainstorming does not have to happen by yourself. It is tremendously effective when done in a group! Sit down with your team and ask them if they have encountered
    a similar problem before, and if they have some ideas, you're in luck. The most important thing to do is to focus on how to fix the root cause, then move onto the other causes that precede that. By the end of your brainstorming, list the top 3 
    best ideas for potential solutions. Again, if you happen to have more than 3, prioritize cutting the list.

</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Plan a Solution</h2>

<p>Here, you'll <strong>narrow down</strong> your list of 3 potential solutions to just 1. Don't worry about whether it will work or not. What you need now is a plan for a solution to minimize how long you'll be spending on this step. Often, 
    your ideas are all great. Planning doesn't mean you put your ideas in your head. Take your engineering notebook and add your team's plan for your solution. It should include dates, times, names, responsibilities, stages, and descriptions. 
    A way to develop this plan into a more <strong>accessible</strong> format is to put it on a device, or even better, on an organized folder. For engineering, <strong>Studio 2.0</strong> is the standard. Check out Module 2 to learn about what it is, 
    and how to use it.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Build a Prototype</h2>

<p>You <strong>build</strong> your first prototype for the solution you planned. You can use your Studio 2.0 plan to replicate what you've thought of in real life. This stage may take up the bulk of your time, but it is also crucial. 
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Test Your Prototype</h2>

<p>Testing is done most often during the entire Engineering Design Process, but it acts similar to tests at school. You can "think" something works, but you can't guarantee it. For example, if you test your prototype and it works 19 out of 20 times, 
    you've lost reliability on 5% of your runs. This adds uncertainty, especially if you ever use your prototype at a competition. Perfection is unlikely to happen, but you want to <strong>run your prototype</strong> (having it do the same function) 20 times to see how many times 
    it achieves your goal. At the end, <strong>record your results</strong> and add descriptions for each time. 
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Iterate Your Prototype</h2>

<p><strong>Add changes</strong> wherever necessary to the tool, depending on what you recorded, and use your descriptions as advice. <strong>Take pictures</strong> of what you changed and add it to Studio 2.0. If you are stuck on iteration (not able to solve problem), scrap your idea and start brand new.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Share the Results (Communicate)</h2>

<p>Sharing your results to your team is an additional step to let your team know why your tool worked or didn't work, and where. This is <strong>unavoidable</strong> because it gives your team real information that can come back and help you later, especially if you encounter a similar problem 
    and brainstorm with your team. In that case, they would respond quickly with an idea. This makes productivity better.
