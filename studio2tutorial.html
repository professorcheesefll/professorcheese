<h1>Module 2: Using Studio 2.0 for Planning</h1>
<p>Studio is a <strong>CAD (Computer Aided Design)</strong> tool specifically made to help builders <strong>plan</strong> a certain creation, like a MOC, before ordering parts and building it in real life. 
    For FLL, it helps students share their ideas without having to build something in real life first. Just imagine if you had to take apart your entire tool just to make a simple 
    change! That would be strenuous, and doesn't yield <strong>results</strong> unless you are very experienced. In short, Studio is a designing tool optimized for efficiency.

<h2>Download Studio 2.0</h2>

<p>If you haven't already, download Studio for your device using this link below to the direct Bricklink site.</p>
<a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page" target="_blank" class="linkbutton">Download Studio 2.0</a>
<p>Simply follow Bricklink's download button, and you should have Studio downloading. Once downloaded, click on the "Downloads" button at the top right of your browser and click on the most recent download to open the package. 
    Unfortunately, Studio doesn't work on certain devices, and a desktop is highly recommended.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Creating Your First CAD File</h2>

<p>After opening Studio and setting everything up for it (with the help of Bricklink) you should see a menu to the left of your window that looks like this:</p>
<img src="module2image1.png" class="rounded-image">
<p>Click on "Create New". For now, don't worry about creating an account for Studio, as we'll save anything that comes after this in a folder on Google Drive.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Your Studio Workspace</h2>

<p>You will see a screen with a platform to place bricks on, various menus, and some tools at the top left of the window.</p>
<img src="module2image2.png" class="rounded-image">
<p>This is going to be your Studio <strong>Workspace</strong>, where you'll be able to build your idea and work on the <strong>planning</strong> section of the Engineering Design Process. 
    Thankfully, there are some <strong>tools</strong> within the workspace that will help you do just that.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Important Settings</h2>

<p>Before we learn about adding bricks, ensure:</p>
<img src="module2image3.png" class="rounded-image">
<ul class="normalul">
    <li>
        You have selected "INSERT". This enables you to <strong>add</strong> parts.

    </li>

    <li>
        Your window for Studio is in full screen mode.
    </li>

    <li>
        If you are building with SPIKE Prime specifically (for FLL) you can switch between the "45678-1 SPIKE Prime Set" option and "Main". 
        <img src="module2image4.png" class="rounded-image">
    </li>

</ul>

<p>If you cannot do the last bullet point, it means you do not have the SPIKE Prime set installed onto Studio. In order to access special parts, specifically from certain sets, you <strong>need</strong> to import them. 
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Importing a Set (SPIKE Prime) to Studio</h2>

<h3>Step 1</h3>

<p>Briefly go back to Studio's home. Look at the menu on the left. Click on "Import LEGO Sets". This enables Studio to add a package to your workspace.</p>

<img src="module2image5.png" class="rounded-image">

<h3>Step 2</h3>

<p>Now, you'll get welcomed by a screen that might look something like the image below. You want to focus on the search bar.</p>

<img src="module2image6.png" class="rounded-image">

<h3>Step 3</h3>

<p>Enter in "45678" and you should be able to add in the SPIKE Prime kit after seeing this:</p>

<img src="module2image7.png" class="rounded-image">

<h3>Step 4</h3>

<p>Click on "Import as Palette".</p>
<img src="module2image8.png" class="rounded-image">

<p>Congratulations! You've Added The SPIKE Prime Set!</p>

<h2>Placing Your First Part</h2>

<p>There are a variety of ways to add parts onto your Studio Workspace, but it ultimately depends on what you feel is most intuitive.</p>

<h3>Using the Search Bar</h3>

<p>This is what the search bar looks like.</p>

<img src="module2image10.png" class="rounded-image">

<p>For instance, this is a search for a "Technic, Liftarm Thick 1x15". This is what pops up.</p>

<img src="module2image11.png" class="rounded-image">

<p>Now, you can <strong>drag</strong> the icon for the first part into the workspace to add it.</p>

<img src="module2image12.png" class="rounded-image">

<p>You've just added a part into your Studio Workspace. Great job! Keep in mind that whenever you're using the search bar to add a certain part, you would <strong>need</strong> to know the <strong>exact name</strong> of it. 
    Make sure you know what the name of a certain part is. You'll be able to find these names either by scrolling through Studio's parts list, or with a web browser.

</p>

<h3>Using Studio's Categories</h3>

<p>When you look to the left of your workspace, you'll be able to see a critical component that saves you from memorizing names of certain parts. Below is a dropdown of the categories 
    of parts you can scroll through.
</p>

<img src="module2image13.png" class="rounded-image">

<p>In FLL, the most used categories are the "Technic", "Technic, Linker", "Technic, Functional" , and the selection "45678-1 SPIKE Prime Set". The SPIKE Prime set selection is above the dropdown (as shown before), but the rest are below. 
    For instance, you can scroll down to the "Technic" section, and select it. It should look like this:
</p>

<img src="module2image14.png" class="rounded-image">

<p>From here, you may drag parts in using the icons. This reduces the need to know exact part names, and can be beneficial if you are trying to meet a deadline. </p>

<img src="module2image15.png" class="rounded-image">

<p>Pro tip: using Studio's categories is often much more effective than parsing through thousands of part names.</p>

<h3>Colorizing Your Parts</h3>

<p>While your team's performance may never benefit from choosing a "good" color for your parts, you should color-code your builds in Studio so others looking at it can easily identify and process it. Here are a few reasons why:</p>

<ul class="normalulelaborate">

    <li>
        A team member trying to assemble your build can easily recognize what a certain part is and where to find it because SPIKE sets and LEGOs in general follow a color scheme for parts. This makes building easier.
    </li>

    <li>
        A coach, mentor, or judge can familiarize themselves with a certain creation with their experience from real life.
    </li>

    <li>
        Your build looks more organized, tidy, and neat, giving you self-esteem to build more and form connection with parts.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the build so far, colorized:</p>

<img src="module2image16.png" class="rounded-image">

<p>Here is the coloring menu seen on Studio, typically on the top-left of the window:</p>

<h2>Connecting Parts Together</h2>

<p>To connect parts together, you want to select the part. 3 axes should appear.</p>

<img src="module2image18.png" class="rounded-image">

<p>You now have 2 options. You may use the arrow keys on your keyboard to rotate the part in the right direction (to enable connection) or use the mouse to rotate the part manually. This is an example of the friction pin being rotated the right way 
    in order to achieve connection:
</p>

<img src="module2image19.png" class="rounded-image">

<p>Now, you can drag the part around until it is over the part you want to connect it with, and it should connect intuitively. You may have to drag you mouse down precisely to lead the part to the right spot.</p>

<img src="module2image20.png" class="rounded-image">

<p>Excellent! You should now be able to attach virtually any part to another, including axles, normal lego bricks, frames, and other exotic elements.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Use the Tools</h2>

<p>Studio has specific tools that make the building process even more effective. Here is a small overview of each of them.</p>

<img src="module2image21.png" class="rounded-image">

<h3>The "Select" Tool</h3>

<p>By selecting the "Select" tool, you are able to select a part and drag it around. That is its function. Simple. It is also the most <strong>crucial</strong> one, which is why it is at the top of the list.
</p>

<img src="module2image22.png" class="rounded-image">
<h3>The "Hinge" Tool</h3>

<p>The "Hinge" tool enables you to directly implement an element's x, y, and z axes with the level of rotation you want.</p>

<img src="module2image23.png" class="rounded-image">

<h3>The "Move" Tool</h3>

<p>Unlike the "Select" tool which also allows you to move a piece, the "Move" tool does it in a linear manner, while showing you the exact coordinates of a piece, improving control over the part of interest.</p>

<img src="module2image24.png" class="rounded-image">

<h3>The "Clone" Tool</h3>

<p>The "Clone" tool is like your copy-and-paste. It allows you to duplicate a part easily, to avoid using fancy keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<img src="module2image25.png" class="rounded-image">

<h3>The "Hide" Tool</h3>

<p>This tool allows you to hide chosen pieces. This can be useful if you want to think about whether you want to add a certain piece or not, or just to see a model removing the chosen part(s) without deleting them.</p>

<img src="module2image26.png" class="rounded-image">

<h3>The "Connect" Tool</h3>

<p>The "Connect" tool may seem counter-intuitive at first, but upon selecting it, you should be able to see cylinders structured around a part. This is a point of connection. Now, using the weird green line that follows your mouse, 
    you can choose a second point of connection. This eliminates the need for strenuous dragging, which can be highly beneficial for long CAD design hours. Highly recommended!

<h2>Advisory Selections</h2>

<p>Studio has some advisory selection options to guide you when you are building to give you a sense of how "correct" your CAD is.</p>

<h3>The "Collision" Advisory</h3>

<p>When selected, this prompts you to change parts that are physically impossible to connect the way you've connected them. Hence, "Collision" is the name. 
    For instance, this is the current model <strong>without</strong> this advisory turned on:
</p>

<img src="module2image28.png" class="rounded-image">

<p>This is the current model <strong>with</strong> the advisory turned on:</p>

<img src="module2image29.png" class="rounded-image">

<p>If corrected, the model might look like this:</p>

<img src="module2image30.png" class="rounded-image">


<h3>The "Stability" Advisory</h3>

<p>When turned on, this advisory shows you if your model falls down easily-- useful if you are building a robot, because that may signal a lack of weight further down rather than up.</p>

<img src="module2image31.png" class="rounded-image">

<p>The green area corresponds to how stable your build can be physically (a smaller area usually means it can fall down easily). Studio also shows clutch power issues and warnings. These represent any issues with the connectivity of the 
    build, which is very important for performance at competitions.
