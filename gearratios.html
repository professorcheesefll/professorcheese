            <h1>Module 5: Gear Ratios</h1>

            <p>In the previous module, you learned about what gears were. To expand your knowledge, you'll learn exactly what gear ratios are, how to calculate them, and what they mean. You'll take a look at torque and speed.</p>
        </div>
        </section>

<h2>Gear Ratios</h2>

<p>A ratio is a <strong>comparison</strong> between two quantities in the simplest terms, usually expressed as "<i>a</i>:<i>b</i>". The variables <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> represent 2 numbers. 
    We compare gear trains using their gear ratios, where <i>a</i> is the number of teeth the driver gear has, and <i>b</i> is the number of teeth the follower gear has. It doesn't stop there, because you can have 
    many follower gears and the comparison would become <i>a</i>:<i>b</i>:<i>c</i>. This may be hard to understand at first, but after understanding why it matters, it should be very intuitive.
</p>

</div>

<p>
    Here, the larger tan driver gear is a "Technic, Gear 20 Tooth Bevel", while the smaller tan follower gear is a "Technic, Gear 12 Tooth Bevel". That means our gear ratio, <i>a</i>:<i>b</i> is 20:12 or 
    5:3.
</p>

<h3>What Does That Mean?</h3>

<p>The ratio of 5:3 is a comparison of both gears' teeth, but it also means that every 3 times the driver gear rotates, the follower gear rotates 5 times. That might sound odd, but it's intentional. 
    A gear with more teeth (assuming a larger diameter and gear compatibility) spins a gear with less teeth faster than itself. For contrast, here is a gear train that has a 1:1 gear ratio (1:1 for speed as well):

</div>

<p>When you have a 1:1 gear ratio, nothing about the rotation changes in the follower gear. This will be important later when we discuss why we apply certain ratios to contraptions. For stark contrast, here is a 3:5 gear ratio: </p>

    <a href="Module 5 | Model 3.io" class="linkbutton linkbutton--newline" download>Download Studio 2.0 File</a>
</div>

<p>With this 3:5 gear ratio, every 5 times the driver gear turns, the follower gear turns 3 times.</p>

<h2>How Does the Amount of Rotations Change?</h2>

<p>No one wants you to believe that something makes sense just because Professor Cheese said it. The reason why the amount of rotations rotated in a certain period of time changes is because of a highly overlooked reason. 
    The speed changes because a <strong>smaller gear (with less teeth) has less teeth per degree</strong>. A <strong>larger gear (with more teeth) has more teeth per degree</strong>, assuming both gears have the same spacing between any 2 teeth. 
    However, the amount of degrees in a circle, 360, stays the same, no matter what kind of gear you have. The number of teeth moved on each gear also stay the same. For example, a "Technic, Gear 36 Tooth Double Bevel" has 9 teeth every 90 degrees:
</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a "Technic, Gear 12 Tooth Double Bevel" gear such as the one below has only 3 teeth per 90 degrees:</p>

<img src="module5image5.png" class="rounded-image">

<p>This means in a scnario where the 36 tooth gear was the driver gear and the 12 tooth gear was the follower gear, every 90 degrees that the large gear turns, the small one turns triple that!</p>

    <h2>Torque</h2>

    <p>Torque is simply a rotational force. It's how much power you are getting from a gear train (for now). You're increasing torque whenever the gear ratio compares a lower number to a higher number. For example, a gear ratio of 3:5 is an increase in torque. Torque is essentially power, meaning it 
        is very useful when you've got a robot trying to lift something heavy. The follower gear would rotate slower, but the amount of energy put in must stay about the same no matter what. An increase in strength would satisfy that.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Speed</h2>

    <p>
        Speed in this context is referring to the amount of complete rotations a gear rotates in a given period of time compared to another gear. You're increasing speed whenever the gear ratio compares a higher number to a lower number. For example, a gear ratio of 5:3 is an increase in speed. Speed is very good for tasks that require something to move faster, with less focus on how much power something needs. 
        Such a ratio might be useful when a task needs to be completed in a time constraint (such as an FLL match of 2:30).
    </p>
</section>


<section>
    <h2>The Tradeoff</h2>

    <p>
        When you have torque, you lose speed. When you have speed, you lose torque. This is because energy that transfers from one gear to another stays about the same (and might even reduce because of energy loss through friction and heat). However, both torque and speed have their own applications.
    </p>

    <ul class="normalul">
        <li>
            Torque provides precision and strength (power)
        </li>

        <li>
            Speed provides efficiency under specific time constraints
        </li>
    </ul>
</section>


<section>
    <h2>Idler Gears</h2>

    <p>
        These are gears that only relay motion and change the direction. They don't add to a gear train with speed or torque. For example, a follower gear in a 1:1 gear train is an idler gear. The 1:1 gear ratio Studio model earlier is a perfect example of an idler gear.
