        <h1>Module 4: Gears</h1>

        <p>Gears transfer <strong>rotational movement</strong> from one location to another by interlocking their teeth. In this module, we'll specifically explore driver and follower gears, why gears have teeth, SPIKE Prime's own default gears and how you can expand them with the SPIKE Expansion kit.</p>

    <h2>Using the Proper Terminology</h2>
    <p>Referring to the features on a gear with the right words is important because:</p>
    <ul class="normalul">
        <li>
            If every teammate uses the same words for a thing, there's way less confusion.
        </li>

        <li>
            Once you start using the right words, you'll also know what each feature does.
        </li>

        <li>
            Judges will understand what you are trying to say during a robot design presentation because you speak in the same language they do.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Driver Gear vs. Follower Gear</h3>
    <p>Look at the gear train below. </p>
    <div class="glass">
    <img src="module4image1.png" class="rounded-image">
    <a href="Module 4 | Model 1.io" class="linkbutton linkbutton--newline" download>Download Studio 2.0 File</a>
    </div>
    <p>The <strong>driver gear</strong> is the gear that initiates the motion. That means it is the gear that is spun by the motor (in FLL's case).</p>
    <p>The <strong>follower gear</strong> is the gear that gets turned by the driver gear. It "follows" the driver gear.</p>
    <p>In this case, that means the black gear in the image is the driver gear because it is being rotated by the motor, while the tan gear is the follower gear. Having a driver gear and a follower gear isn't restricted to perpendicular connections.</p>
    <div class="glass">
        <img src="module4image2.png" class="rounded-image">
        <a href="Module 4 | Model 2.io" class="linkbutton linkbutton--newline" download>Download Studio 2.0 File</a>
    </div>
    <p>In the image above, the driver gear is now the smaller, black gear. The follower gear is the tan gear.</p>

    <h3>Gear Teeth</h3>

    <img src="module4image3.png" class="rounded-image">
    <p>You've probably noticed that gears have these sharp, jagged, and pointy spikes around them. These are called <strong>teeth</strong>. They make a gear train more effective by providing:</p>

    <ul class="normalul">
        <li>
            Grip and friction with surrounding connected gears
        </li>

        <li>
            Provide consistent spacing between any gears
        </li>

        <li>
            Provide smooth and consistent rotational motion
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Knowing the amount of teeth a gear has is important later on when we reach module 5.</p>

        <h2>SPIKE Prime's Default Gears</h2>

        <p>These are SPIKE Prime's default gears for you to select from:</p>
        <img src="module4image4.png" class="rounded-image">
        <p>As you can see, they're quite limited, which is why you might need something called the SPIKE Expansion Set.</p>
    </section>
    <section>

        <h2>SPIKE Expansion Set</h2>

        <p>The SPIKE Expansion Set has more parts and gears to choose from, and can significantly increase the amount of contraptions you can build. Since it is standard practice for many teams to already have this set, here are some steps to add it to Studio 2.0:</p>

        <h3>Step 1</h3>

        <p>Click on "Import LEGO Sets" in Studio's home.</p>

        <img src="module4image5.png" class="rounded-image">

        <h3>Step 2</h3>

        <p>Search for "45681" and you'll see the SPIKE Expansion Set.</p>

        <img src="module4image6.png" class="rounded-image">

        <h3>Step 3</h3>

        <p>Add the set to Studio by clicking on "Import as a palette".</p>

        <img src="module4image7.png" class="rounded-image">

        <h3>Step 4</h3>

        <p>You should now have more gears to choose from in your palette when you've selected "45681-1 SPIKE Prime Expansion Set".</p>
